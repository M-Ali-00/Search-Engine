# 🧠 Member 3: Search Intelligence & Vector Database

## Overview
This module acts as the "Brain" of the project. It handles:
1.  **Ingestion:** Receiving clean data from Member 2.
2.  **Chunking:** Breaking long text into smaller, digestible pieces.
3.  **Vectorization:** Turning text into numerical embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.
4.  **Storage:** Saving these vectors into a persistent `ChromaDB` database.
5.  **Search:** Retrieving the most relevant text chunks based on a user's query.

## 📂 File Structure
* `ingest.py`: The entry point for saving data. (Used by Member 2's pipeline).
* `search.py`: The entry point for finding data. (Used by Member 4's API).
* `database.py`: Manages the connection to ChromaDB.
* `embedder.py`: Handles the AI conversion of text to numbers.
* `chunker.py`: Logic for splitting large pages into smaller segments.
* `test.py`: A script to manually verify that ingestion and search are working.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1.  **Install Requirements:**
    You will need `chromadb` and `sentence-transformers`.
    ```bash
    pip install chromadb sentence-transformers
    ```

2.  **First Run (Ingest Data):**
    Uncomment the ingestion lines in `test.py` to add your first data points to the local database.

3.  **Verify (Search):**
    Run the test script to see if the database returns relevant results.
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

## 🔌 API Usage (For Teammates)

### For Member 2 (The Filter)
To send data to the Brain, import `ingest_page` and pass a dictionary:
```python
from ingest import ingest_page

data = {
    "url": "[https://example.com](https://example.com)",
    "title": "Example Page",
    "text": "Full page text goes here..."
}

ingest_page(data)
